## About Me

My fascination with biology began at age 4, when I discovered dinosaurs. Since the Human Genome Project, I've been convinced that bioinformatics is the key to unlocking biology’s greatest challenges. I aim to apply computational tools to solve real-world biological problems and make a tangible impact.

I bring a strong background in genomics, ecology, statistics, and data science. I'm focused on improving my coding skills, contributing to open-source bioinformatics projects, and creating innovative tools of my own.

- 🔬 Research interests: wet lab, ecology, omics technologies—and always curious to explore new fields!
- 💻 Actively strengthening my programming and data analysis skills
- 🛠️ Eager to create bioinformatics solutions that empower researchers and accelerate scientific discovery
